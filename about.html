    </td> <td><p>The second important aspect in life is to know oneself. We are like icebergs. Only twenty percent of
      our character and real self is exposed and eighty percent is hidden and unexplored. We fear to open our inner self as we fear to
    open the bills in the beginning of the month which might eat up the whole of the earnings. A walk into our inner self might
    sometimes consume all the delight and makeup we put on and made the world around us to believe. Probing and introspecting in to
    the real self is pricking and hurting and therefore we begin to float on shallow waters of slender delights than attempt to delve
    deep waters to search for the pearls.

  St. Vincent De Paul was born on 24th April, 1581 in Pouy, a little village near Dax in France. His parents were Jean de Paul   and Bertrand de Moras. He became a priest on 23rd September, 1600. After six decades of priestly life, Fr.Vincent breathed
   his last on 27th September, 1660 pronouncing the holy name of Jesus. "A saint has died" was a popular expression of the crowd
  who attended the funeral. Pope Benedict XIII beatified him on 13th August, 1724, and he was canonized on 16th June 1737. On May 12th, 1885, Pope Leo XIII declared him "the Patron of all works of charity in the Universal Church".
The name Vincent means a winner, conqueror. St. Vincent de Paul lived through a time lasting little less than a century like a winner
. Like a sure winner he held in his hands the most powerful arms, the arms of Gospel maxims before which enemies such as power, ambition,
greed and love of the world went down on their knees before the personal life of sanctity of Vincent. He was Vincent in his life and his
contemporaries of high rank saw in him an incorrupt and incorruptible person. Let the story of his life speak for itself.
