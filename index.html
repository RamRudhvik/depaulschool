      The second important aspect in life is to know oneself. We are like icebergs. Only twenty percent of our character and real self is exposed    and eighty percent is hidden and unexplored. We fear to open our inner self as we fear to open the bills in the beginning of the month
      which might eat up the whole of the earnings. A walk into our inner self might sometimes consume all the delight and makeup we put on
      and made the world around us to believe. Probing and introspecting in to the real self is pricking and hurting and therefore we begin
      to float on shallow waters of slender delights than attempt to delve deep waters to search for the pearls.<br><br><br>

       The Congregation of the Mission was founded by St. Vincent De Paul in France in the year 1625. This “Little Company” thrived to a great spiritual edifice in course
       of time and today the Congregation of the Mission has about 4,000 members in 46 Provinces and 5 Vice-Provinces scattered over 86 countries.
      In July 1963, just before the General Assembly of that year the Generalate was shifted from Paris to Rome, doing away completely
      from the influence of the French government and becoming more international. In the year 1922 Vincentian Spanish Missionaries came to India,
      and started their services in Orissa, and in course of time it became a province. In 1997 the Indian Province was bifurcated into two major
     provinces as North Indian Province and South Indian Province.
